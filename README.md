## Circle detection in pictures (detect_circles.jl)

First, we load the image and convert it to grayscale. 
Applying a [Gaussian filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_filter) on it helps with the detection that is done in the next part of the code.

```julia
img = Gray.(load("C:\\Users\\Yasmine\\SANDBOX\\git files\\pontedera\\images_semaine1\\gaia1.jpg"));
img = imfilter(img, Kernel.gaussian(3));
```
[Canny edge detection algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector) is applied on the blurred picture. The spatial-scale can be tuned to reduce the noise on the resultant image "img_edges".


```Julia
img_edges = detect_edges(img, Canny(spatial_scale = 3)) 
dx, dy=imgradients(img, KernelFactors.ando5);
img_phase = phase(dx, dy)
```

img_edges and img_phase are used in the [Hough Circle Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_Hough_Transform) function to detect the circles in img. The third parameter is an array of radii of circles we want to detect. This is the most important parameter to tune with precision.

```Julia
circle_centers, circle_radius = hough_circle_gradient(bool_img_edges, img_phase, 8:10)
```
To visualize the detection, the following lines plot img_edges with the circle centers.

```Julia
img_demo = Float64.(bool_img_edges); for c in circle_centers img_demo[c] = 2; end
imshow(img_demo)
```
## Tracking circular shapes in video and on camera live stream 
## (track_particles.jl and track_particles_live.jl)

Using [BlobTracking.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/BlobTracking.jl) package, which uses [Laplacian-of-Gaussian filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_detection) (from [Images.jl](https://juliaimages.org/latest/function_reference/#Images.blob_LoG)) and a Kalman filter from [LowLevelParticleFilters.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/LowLevelParticleFilters.jl).
